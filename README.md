Hello! I have decided that I will no longer be updating the AceHub Script Hub Since I will be focusing on other things that will come in AceHub's future.
Since I am done updatinf the script I have decided to make it open source. I am aware that the script looks like shit, this is bacause I had no understanding of lua
when I started this Script Hub and I learned the language as I make more. You are free to use the script in anyway you wish. I hope to see people learning off of this
especially since I was able to make all this with no prior knowledge in lua itself.
